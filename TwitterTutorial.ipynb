    "The more sophisticated approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, you need to understand how the infinite scrolling works. In the case of this tutorial, when the tweet search page loaded, none of the tweets contents were loaded at the time. It is the frontend javascript code that sends the HTTP request to get tweets from the server asynchronously, and manipulates the HTML file to render those tweets. This technology is called AJAX. You may find more information online if you are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay! This is the approach I want to show you. Think about the problem this way: no matter how sophisticated the website is designed, the end result is still a list of tweets loaded on your browser. So my so-called more naive approach is to focus on the end result only. if we could manipulate the browser to load those tweets for me, just as what we see normally, we could use the same the knowledge to parse the HTML file and get the tweets. To automate the browser for us, I’ll show you how I used Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Selenium automates browsers.” That’s what the official website says. Selenium Python bindings will help us to use Selenium using Python. Follow the installation page to install it. The code below tells Selenium to use Chrome to open up the Twitter search page and then move down the page for 5 times. Since the browser object provides the handy API to locate the tweets, we don’t need to use the BeautifulSoup again to parse the HTML file. You may run the script now:"

(milk sugar coffee) and (x := a * 2 b) are both valid s-expressions. The means for example that one can easily write infix expressions as s-expressions.

What does it mean to eval a type definition? Old values are invalid now? Or both new ones and old ones coexist? If you use maps the question is irrelevant.
